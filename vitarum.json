Euricom offers multiple different internships, in which I chose to develop the training catalog 2.0\\. The internship at Euricom was designed to be completed with two people (which I did with a fellow student), with a technical lead and product owner also involved. This allowed me to develop my team skills and gain experience working together in an agile way, using Scrum in a team context for the first time.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nThe training catalog was already available on Euricom's SharePoint. However, this had a poor UI/UX so our task became to create a new way for employees to request and book trainings and manage events. The first step was to write a technical and functional analysis. We decided to use React as the frontend technology, .NET as our backend and SQL as our database. This project eventually consisted of a calendar view and an overview of all available trainings and events, featuring various filtering and sorting options. Additionally, there was a personal training track and the ability to retrieve information about all participating events. For each event, it was also possible to request related assets.\n\n<br />\n\nThis internship lasted a total of 4 months and in order to fully complete this assignment, we also had to write a paper about the project and defend it to a jury during a presentation.",

Another part in the BE was the migration of the old database to a new database. To keep both databases in sync we SQL used change tracking in combination with Azure Service Bus. Further to develop these new features in the FE I used React, SASS and Yarn in a single SPA.\n\n<br />\n\nAfter the merger with Zenchef we got the task to set up a new B2C project with the goal to make a fast scalable app where we also needed to pay attention to good SEO.

This was a full stack project where we had to use .NET Core as backend framework and for the frontend we had a free choice. Because we only saw Angular in school and we didn’t think this framework suited our idea, we decided to start learning a new framework called React Native. After making a technical and functional analysis we started creating the application.\n\n<br />\n\nThe city game we created was meant to guide visitors to as many beautiful monuments of Antwerp as possible. The game could be used by groups of visitors of Antwerp. Everyone had to boot up the app and one person had to create a game session that others could join. After setting a time limit, the game can start. Once the game started all users see a map of Antwerp, highlighted with all the locations of different monuments. The goal was to visit as many monuments as possible within the given time limit. Once a user got close enough to the monument, he gets points for it. The game ended with a ranking of all the users of that game session and their points.\n\n<br />\n\nTo monitor the activity on our application we also created an Angular admin panel. With this tool we could monitor all active and expired game sessions. As well as the locations of all active users and the route they walked.\n\n<br />",

The store is a shop where restaurant holders can buy more features for example MailChimp marketing, gift cards, table plan, payment system and many more. During this project I worked as a full stack developer. In the Back-end the main goal was to extend and maintain the existing api's. For these api's we used .NET 7\\. Another part in the BE was the migration of the old database to a new database. To keep both databases in sync we SQL used change tracking in combination with Azure Service Bus. Further to develop these new features in the FE I used React, SASS and Yarn in a single SPA.\n\nAfter the merger with Zenchef we got the task to set up a new B2C project with the goal to make a fast scalable app where we also needed to pay attention to good SEO. With that in mind the team and I came to the conclusion to start a new project in NextJs. Here we created our own design system using pandaCSS combined with park-ui.",

This was a full stack project where we had to use .NET Core as backend framework and for the frontend we had a free choice. Because we only saw Angular in school and we didn’t think this framework suited our idea, we decided to start learning a new framework called React Native. After making a technical and functional analysis we started creating the application.\n\n<br />\n\nThe city game we created was meant to guide visitors to as many beautiful monuments of Antwerp as possible. The game could be used by groups of visitors of Antwerp. Everyone had to boot up the app and one person had to create a game session that others could join. After setting a time limit, the game can start. Once the game started all users see a map of Antwerp, highlighted with all the locations of different monuments. The goal was to visit as many monuments as possible within the given time limit. Once a user got close enough to the monument, he gets points for it. The game ended with a ranking of all the users of that game session and their points.\n\n<br />\n\nTo monitor the activity on our application we also created an Angular admin panel. With this tool we could monitor all active and expired game sessions. As well as the locations of all active users and the route they walked.\n\n<br />",

The store is a shop where restaurant holders can buy more features for example MailChimp marketing, gift cards, table plan, payment system and many more. During this project I worked as a full stack developer. In the Back-end the main goal was to extend and maintain the existing api's. For these api's we used .NET 7\\. Another part in the BE was the migration of the old database to a new database. To keep both databases in sync we SQL used change tracking in combination with Azure Service Bus. Further to develop these new features in the FE I used React, SASS and Yarn in a single SPA.\n\nAfter the merger with Zenchef we got the task to set up a new B2C project with the goal to make a fast scalable app where we also needed to pay attention to good SEO. With that in mind the team and I came to the conclusion to start a new project in NextJs. Here we created our own design system using pandaCSS combined with park-ui.",

This was a full stack project where we had to use .NET Core as backend framework and for the frontend we had a free choice. Because we only saw Angular in school and we didn’t think this framework suited our idea, we decided to start learning a new framework called React Native. After making a technical and functional analysis we started creating the application.\n\n<br />\n\nThe city game we created was meant to guide visitors to as many beautiful monuments of Antwerp as possible. The game could be used by groups of visitors of Antwerp. Everyone had to boot up the app and one person had to create a game session that others could join. After setting a time limit, the game can start. Once the game started all users see a map of Antwerp, highlighted with all the locations of different monuments. The goal was to visit as many monuments as possible within the given time limit. Once a user got close enough to the monument, he gets points for it. The game ended with a ranking of all the users of that game session and their points.\n\n<br />\n\nTo monitor the activity on our application we also created an Angular admin panel. With this tool we could monitor all active and expired game sessions. As well as the locations of all active users and the route they walked.\n\n<br />",

The store is a shop where restaurant holders can buy more features for example MailChimp marketing, gift cards, table plan, payment system and many more. During this project I worked as a full stack developer. In the Back-end the main goal was to extend and maintain the existing api's. For these api's we used **.NET 7**. Another part in the BE was the migration of the old database to a new database. To keep both databases in sync we used SQL change tracking in combination with **Azure Service Bus**. Further to develop these new features in the FE I used **React**, **SASS** and **Yarn** in a **single SPA**.<br /><br />After the merger with Zenchef we got the task to set up a new B2C project with the goal to make a fast scalable app where we also needed to pay attention to good SEO. With that in mind the team and I came to the conclusion to start a new project in **NextJs.**Here we created our own design system using **pandaCSS** combined with **park-ui**.",

Important to note that prior to development we did the analysis ourself. Ranging from putting together a feasible architecture to finding out the specific needs of the user for the internal application and the API. With daily standups and a 3 weekly sprint planning we estimated our work and we kept an overview (Jira).\n\nOne of the metrics we accomplished what I am proud of, is that we reached an overall testing coverage of 80% (integration & unit tests).<br />",

One of them is the reservation widget where customers can book a reservation. The second part they specialize in is the backoffice for the restaurant holders. In this backoffice restaurant holders can manage bookings, their table setup, invoices, company information,... <br /><br />My job was to develop new features for the Resengo Store. The store is a shop where restaurant holders can buy more features for example MailChimp marketing, gift cards, table plan, payment system and many more. During this project I worked as a full stack developer. In the Back-end the main goal was to extend and maintain the existing api's. For these api's we used **.NET 7**. Another part in the BE was the migration of the old database to a new database. To keep both databases in sync we SQL used change tracking in combination with **Azure Service Bus**. Further to develop these new features in the FE I used **React**, **SASS** and **Yarn** in a **single SPA**.<br /><br />After the merger with Zenchef we got the task to set up a new B2C project with the goal to make a fast scalable app where we also needed to pay attention to good SEO. With that in mind the team and I came to the conclusion to start a new project in **NextJs.**Here we created our own design system using **pandaCSS** combined with **park-ui**.",

They provide digital solutions and IT services to the community of insurance brokers, insurance companies and to the customers of the brokers.\n\nThe insurance distribution market is expected to evolve strongly in the coming years, as competition from bank assurance and direct insurance companies increases. They also observe that the number of brokers is consolidating as a consequence of mergers and acquisitions. In order to make the new delivery model a reality, they need to make important investments and innovations in their products.\n\n<br />\n\nThe project I worked on was called the repairer project. The main objective of this project was to get an existing application running in the **Cloud (Azure)**. There were 2 parts:\n\n*   API with endpoints that would be used for an existing application called Brio\n\n*   Internal application that is responsible for consuming the data that afterwards will be used for the Brio application.<br />To fulfill the task, we needed to **generate** an **API, internal application, DB, AAD**... My role in this project was mainly generating the frontend of the internal application in **React**. I also helped in the **Backend** where possible. The Backend was written in **.NET** in combination with a **SQL DB.<br /><br />**\n\nI worked in an agile team with 2 other .NET developers. The 3 of us had ownership for completing this assignment. Important to note that prior to development we did the analysis ourself. Ranging from putting together a feasible architecture to finding out the specific needs of the user for the internal application and the API. With daily standups and a 3 weekly sprint planning we estimated our work and we kept an overview (Jira).\n\nOne of the metrics we accomplished what I am proud of, is that we reached an overall testing coverage of 80% (integration & unit tests).<br />",

One of them is the reservation widget where customers can book a reservation. The second part they specialize in is the backoffice for the restaurant holders. In this backoffice restaurant holders can manage bookings, their table setup, invoices, company information,...<br /><br />My job was to develop new features for the Resengo Store. The store is a shop where restaurant holders can buy more features for example MailChimp marketing, gift cards, table plan, payment system and many more. During this project I worked as a full stack developer. In the Back-end the main goal was to extend and maintain the existing api's. For these api's we used **.NET 7**. Another part in the BE was the migration of the old database to a new database. To keep both databases in sync we SQL used change tracking in combination with **Azure Service Bus**. Further to develop these new features in the FE I used **React**, **SASS** and **Yarn** in a **single SPA**.<br /><br />After the merger with Zenchef we got the task to set up a new B2C project with the goal to make a fast scalable app where we also needed to pay attention to good SEO. With that in mind the team and I came to the conclusion to start a new project in **NextJs.**Here we created our own design system using **pandaCSS** combined with **park-ui**.",

They provide digital solutions and IT services to the community of insurance brokers, insurance companies and to the customers of the brokers.\n\nThe insurance distribution market is expected to evolve strongly in the coming years, as competition from bank assurance and direct insurance companies increases. They also observe that the number of brokers is consolidating as a consequence of mergers and acquisitions. In order to make the new delivery model a reality, they need to make important investments and innovations in their products.\n\n<br />\n\nThe project I worked on was called the repairer project. The main objective of this project was to get an existing application running in the **Cloud (Azure)**. There were 2 parts:\n\n*   API with endpoints that would be used for an existing application called Brio\n\n*   Internal application that is responsible for consuming the data that afterwards will be used for the Brio application.<br />To fulfill the task, we needed to **generate** an **API, internal application, DB, AAD**... My role in this project was mainly generating the frontend of the internal application in **React**. I also helped in the **Backend** where possible. The Backend was written in **.NET** in combination with a **SQL DB.<br /><br />**\n\nI worked in an agile team with 2 other .NET developers. The 3 of us had ownership for completing this assignment. Important to note that prior to development we did the analysis ourself. Ranging from putting together a feasible architecture to finding out the specific needs of the user for the internal application and the API. With daily standups and a 3 weekly sprint planning we estimated our work and we kept an overview (Jira).\n\nOne of the metrics we accomplished what I am proud of, is that we reached an overall testing coverage of 80% (integration & unit tests).<br />",

This internship took 3 months, and was supervised by internal employees from Euricom, and the school (Thomas More Geel). During this internship a team of 4 people worked on the assignment. The web application was intended to measure how collaboration within a team works. When each team member has completed a questionnaire, a score is calculated. Based on this score, the team leader can see where there are any problems within the team. The strengths of the team could also be revealed by the application. The application also gives tips on how to improve the less good sides of the team.\n\nDuring the internship, we used the Scrum method. There was a frontend and a backend developed for the application. The backend is made with .NET Core and the frontend is built in Angular 7\\. We also have made a PWA application of the frontend, so users could use the application offline on their mobile device. To store data, a Microsoft SQL database was used that was hosted in Azure. Azure AD was used for security. Each member of the development team developed functionalities in both the backend and the frontend.",

The web application was intended to measure how collaboration within a team works. When each team member has completed a questionnaire, a score is calculated. Based on this score, the team leader can see where there are any problems within the team. The strengths of the team could also be revealed by the application.

There was a frontend and a backend developed for the application. The backend is made with .NET Core and the frontend is built in Angular 7\\.

This internship took 3 months, and was supervised by internal employees from Euricom, and the school (Thomas More Geel). During this internship a team of 4 people worked on the assignment. The web application was intended to measure how collaboration within a team works. When each team member has completed a questionnaire, a score is calculated. Based on this score, the team leader can see where there are any problems within the team. The strengths of the team could also be revealed by the application. The application also gives tips on how to improve the less good sides of the team.\n\nDuring the internship, we used the Scrum method. There was a frontend and a backend developed for the application. The backend is made with .NET Core and the frontend is built in Angular 7\\. We also have made a PWA application of the frontend, so users could use the application offline on their mobile device. To store data, a Microsoft SQL database was used that was hosted in Azure. Azure AD was used for security. Each member of the development team developed functionalities in both the backend and the frontend.",

Next, after some refresh of CSS and **refactoring techniques**, we went deep in the **application development** with Angular & React. Through a **test-driven approach**, we covered multiple patterns and practices.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nThe Bootcamp was given by Euricom JavaScript **experts/architects** and **senior guest speakers** with specialization in sub domains such as end to end testing with Cypress, GraphQL, styled components, VueJS, ORM's and Event Storming workshop.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nTo get a better idea of what makes a software developer a \"professional\", we read, discussed and presented the book \"**The Clean Coder**\" by Robert Cecil Martin otherwise known as Uncle Bob.",

I learned a lot from this, not only about Java and JavaFX, but also about teamwork, which was quite difficult in the beginning. This is also because everything had to be online (covid) and there was no possibility to get to know my teammates better, which of course was a pity .<br />\n\n**<br />**\n\n**CSR-dashboard**<br />\n\nFluvius needed a dashboard to present their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Objectives and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) to their customers.
